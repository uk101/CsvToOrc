# CsvToOrc
Read a CSV log and save it to OrcFile using the https://orc.apache.org/docs/java-tools.html 

A specific CSV from a VPN log was used and thus is not included. The code would need to be modified to suit your CSV. I can report a > 50 times reduction in file size.

## Setup
`mvn install` as usual
